###In JComboBox there is a method getSelectedItem() which is used to return the value selected in JComboBox.
    The return type of this method is object.
    
    Syntax: 
    public object getSelectedItem(){
        
    }
    
    Hence, we need to convert the type to string for which we use the method "toString()" or "String.valueOf()"
